              <p>I've just had the results of the MRI scan and full bone scan from my urologist.</p>
              <p>The MRI came back good with it showing nothing much at all - good news.</p>
              <p>But unfortunately the bone scan has shown the prostate cancer has spread to the bones.</p>
              <p>It has metastasized to multiple areas of the body and has spread rapidly over the last six months - so I now have stage four prostate cancer.</p>
              <p>The treatment will be Hormone therapy, but we may also go to chemotherapy, because it has spread so quickly.</p>
              <p>It's obviously not what I had hoped for - but it is what it is.</p>
              <p>I will fight this the best I can.</p>
